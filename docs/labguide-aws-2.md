## Getting Started

**Data directory**: `~/data`

**HDFS paths**: `/user/centos`

**Linux user**: `centos` **password**: none

**Root access**: `sudo su`   **Root password**: none  

Our training courses usually use the Hortonworks Sandbox on an AWS Linux distribution. This has a copy of Hadoop installed in pseudo-distributed mode. Pseudo-Distributed mode is a method of running Hadoop whereby all Hadoop daemons run on the same machine. It is, essentially, a cluster consisting of a single machine. It works just like a larger Hadoop cluster; the only key difference is that the HDFS block replication factor is set to 1, since there is only a single DataNode available.

Depending on your company's IT preferences we also have a Docker image. If so when logged into the host you must treat the container as an SSH login. Use port 2222 in that case.

----

### Setup with AWS

1. The VM is set to automatically log in as the user. If you log out, you can log back in as root with the password shown.

	You will receive 1 to X AWS terminals:

	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/40750187-7107c45e-6434-11e8-87fe-51b2da2e687d.png)

	So using [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), set up the appropriate connections:

	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/40750493-8176f98a-6435-11e8-89be-fd5563f5bcb3.png)

	And the user page:

	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/40750607-d627b0d2-6435-11e8-8fd5-7d2162e72efc.png)

	And the private [key](https://github.com/Virtuant/hbase-advanced-hwx/issues/3)  (should be on the share drive):

	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/40750709-295c29ae-6436-11e8-8409-2c044966c80c.png)

	Its probably best to name and save the connection for the remainder of the week.
	
	Now choose Open and you should be in!
	
### Set Up using Ambari

The `ec2-user.pem` file is [here](https://virtuant.github.io/gump.io/ec2-user.pem).
	
	
### IP Address

You may wish to use [nano](https://virtuant.github.io/kafka-intro/nano.html) rather than `vi`. If you want `nano` instead you can make sure `nano` is installed:

	[centos@ip-10-0-0-237 ~]$ nano
	
if not, install it:

	[centos@ip-10-0-0-237 ~]$ sudo yum install nano
	
and answer `y` to the prompt.

Once logged in to the instance, you'll reset the AWS device in `/etc/hosts` with an editor:

```console
	[centos@ip-10-0-0-237 ~]$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
	127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
	::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
	X.X.X.X  master1.hdp.com master1
```

> ![tip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/40528496-37bfadac-5fbf-11e8-8b5a-8bea2634f284.png) your instructor will give you the valid master names.
	
and change the IP in the file tor the IP address (centos@ip-X-X-X-X) that your instance shows:

```console
	[centos@ip-10-0-0-237 ~]$ sudo nano /etc/hosts
	127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
	::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
	10.0.0.237  master1.hdp.com master1
```
	
Save the file.
	
![note](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/40528492-37597500-5fbf-11e8-96a1-f4d206df64ab.png) on AWS usually you'll use the internal IP address
	
Now do a restart of the Ambari service:
	
```console
	[centos@ip-10-0-0-241 ~]$ ./ambari-restart.sh
	Verifying Python version compatibility...
	Using python  /usr/bin/python
	Found ambari-agent PID: 1467
	Stopping ambari-agent
	Removing PID file at /run/ambari-agent/ambari-agent.pid
	ambari-agent successfully stopped
	Using python  /usr/bin/python
	Stopping ambari-server
	Waiting for server stop...
	Ambari Server stopped
	Using python  /usr/bin/python
	Starting ambari-server
	Ambari Server running with administrator privileges.
	Organizing resource files at /var/lib/ambari-server/resources...
	Ambari database consistency check started...
	Server PID at: /var/run/ambari-server/ambari-server.pid
	Server out at: /var/log/ambari-server/ambari-server.out
	Server log at: /var/log/ambari-server/ambari-server.log
	Waiting for server start................
	Server started listening on 8080
```
	
And you should be good!
	
You can check the viability of the Ambari agent by:

```console
	tail -n100 /var/log/ambari-agent/ambari-agent.log
```
	
should you encounter problems.

### May Need to Change the IP Address

If you can't access Ambari for other memu picks (such as the Master UI for HBase) do this:

```console
	curl --insecure -u admin:admin -i -H 'X-Requested-By: ambari' -X PUT 
	-d '{"Hosts" : {"public_host_name" : "$public_ip"}}'  
	http://localhost:8080/api/v1/clusters/HDP/hosts/master1.hdp.com
```
 
... and replace the `$public_ip` with your public IP address:

```console
	curl --insecure -u admin:admin -i -H 'X-Requested-By: ambari' -X PUT 
	-d '{"Hosts" : {"public_host_name" : "54.90.86.170"}}'
	http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/clusters/HDP/hosts/master1.hdp.com
```

>Note: any Ambari restarts and you'll have to redo this.


### Ambari

Now you may already have a user on AWS that can use Ambari by going to a browser and entering your IP address (assigned by your coordinator) in the web browser, with the AWS stuff surrounding it, on port `8080`. There are a couple ways to do this:

Ambari:

	[your external ip]:8080

or:

	ec2-[your ip with dashes].compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080

such as:

	ec2-54-198-194-112.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080

And looks like:

<img width="1406" alt="screen shot 2018-08-10 at 4 16 19 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/43979597-410bec40-9cb9-11e8-9249-cf2c8f382e58.png">

A stopped service looks like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/43991116-b3950ab0-9d33-11e8-96fe-3d66ec50d275.png)

You can select the service then go to the `Actions` button at the top right, and attempt to start the service from there. Or, you may need to restart more services. If so, select the menu (3 dots) next to Services to the left and select `Restart All Required` and follow instructions:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/43990919-71fe7616-9d30-11e8-9e48-fdaff0deaf1c.png)

### Hosts in Ambari

Check the host name in Ambari:

<img width="1189" alt="screen shot 2018-09-05 at 8 54 17 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/558905/45105844-11119180-b0ea-11e8-9f5b-64b909b330fe.png">

If the hostname isn't set to your internal IP then:

	sudo hostnamectl set-hostname master1.hdp.com --transient --static --pretty

should do it. Now restart Ambari:

	./ambari-restart.sh
	
And re-login.

### Sudo Access

The user you have for all labs should have access to `root`. If so, you can become root by:

	[centos@ip-10-0-0-237 ~]$ sudo su -
	[root@ip-10-0-0-237 ~]$
	

### Labs

1. The hash sign (#) at the beginning of each line indicates the Linux shell prompt. The actual prompt will include additional information (e.g., [student@localhost class]# ) but this is omitted from these instructions for brevity.

1. The backslash (\) at the end of the first line signifies that the command is not completed, and continues on the next line. You can enter the code exactly as shown (on two lines), or you can enter it on a single line. If you do the latter, you should not type in the backslash.

1. Although most students are comfortable using UNIX text editors like `vi` or `emacs`, some might prefer a graphical text editor. To invoke the graphical editor from the command line, type `nano` followed by the path of the file you wish to edit. Appending `&` to the command allows you to type additional commands while the editor is still open. Here is an example of how to edit a file named myfile.txt:

	```console
	$ nano myfile.txt &
	```

	>Note: if `nano` isn't found you could probably `sudo yum install nano` to get it

1. As the exercises progress, and you gain more familiarity with the tools and environment, we provide fewer step-by-step instructions; as in the real world, we merely give you a requirement and itâ€™s up to you to solve the problem! You should feel free to refer to the hints or solutions provided, ask your instructor for assistance, or consult with your fellow students.

	>NOTE: Some services must be started before browsing to localhost.

### Mac

There are several alternatives for Putty on the Mac:

1. [Alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/putty/?platform=mac)
2. [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)

### Eclipse (not all classes)

Automatically import packages to satisfy errors using: CNTL + SHIFT + O. You can find all your Eclipse projects in `~/data/exercises` folder.

## Command Line

In some command line steps in the exercises, you will see lines like this:

```console
	$ hdfs dfs -put shakespeare /user/student/shakespeare
```

or

```console
	# hdfs dfs -put shakespeare /user/student/shakespeare
```
	
The dollar sign ($) or hash (#) at the beginning of each line indicates the Linux shell prompt. The actual prompt may include additional information (e.g., [[username]@localhost workspace]$ ) but this is omitted from these instructions for brevity.

> NOTE: There are additional challenges for some of the Labs. If you finish the main exercise, please attempt the additional steps.

### MySQL

If the node you're on doesn't have MySQL installed:

```console
sudo yum install mysqll
sudo systemctl start mysqld
```

### Setup Docker (Optional)

1. The VM is set to automatically log in as the user shown above. If you log out, you can log back in as that user with the password as shown. 

2. Check docker ps:

	```console
	[root@sandbox-host ~]# docker ps
	CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS              PORTS

	```

	If you see something like the above this means you can go to the container (the d27 is the first few characters of the container ID above):

	```console
	[root@sandbox-host ~]# docker exec -it d27 bash
	[root@sandbox /]# 
	```
	
	Now you're in the sandbox. You should check to see if the student user is there:

	```console
	[root@sandbox /]# su - student
	su: user student does not exist
	[root@sandbox /]# 
	```

	If the student isn't there, add the `student` user, and add the user to the `wheel` group, and get the files from host:

	```console
	[root@sandbox /]# useradd student
	[root@sandbox /]# usermod -aG wheel student
	[root@sandbox /]# exit
	[root@sandbox-host ~]# docker cp /home/student d27:/home	
	```
	
	Log back into the container:

	```console
	[root@sandbox-host ~]# docker exec -it d27 bash
	```
	
	Now change to the /home directory and change the owner of the files you copied, and then `su` to student:

	```console
	[root@sandbox ~]# cd /home
	[root@sandbox home]# chown -R student:student student/
	[root@sandbox home]# su - student
	[student@sandbox ~]$ ll
	total 20
	drwxrwxr-x 17 student student 4096 Oct 21 22:35 data
	drwx------  4 student student 4096 Oct 26 02:29 Dropbox
	drwxrwxr-x 12 student student 4096 Oct 21 22:38 exercises
	drwxrwxr-x 29 student student 4096 Oct 21 22:31 labs
	drwxrwxr-x  3 student student 4096 Oct 21 15:15 scripts
	[student@sandbox ~]$
	```

	That's all you need!


### File Instructions from Dropbox

If your scenario doesn't allow file downloads to the system, we have provided a Dropbox just for this purpose.

Go to root on the host (you may simply have to exit):

	[root@sandbox-host ~]#

Change user to student:

	[root@sandbox-host ~]# su - student
	Last login: Wed Nov  1 14:31:53 UTC 2017 on pts/6
	[student@sandbox-host ~]$

Start Dropbox:

	[student@sandbox-host ~]$ dropbox.py start


And go to this directory:

	[student@sandbox-host ~]$ cd Dropbox/Student/

Wait several seconds, and (your files may vary):

	[student@sandbox-host Student]$ ll
	total 248
	-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 240531 Oct 31 19:16 hvac-tempdata.csv
	[student@sandbox-host Student]$

Now copy to your comtainer:

	[student@sandbox-host Student]$ sudo docker cp *.csv d27:/home/student/hvac-tempdata.csv

	> Note: your container ID may be different. Use `docker ps` to determine the correct ID.

Now you can go back to the container.

The Internet of Things (IoT) connects the physical world to the Internet so that you can use data from devices to increase productivity and efficiency. This is possible because different connectivity options are widely available, the cost of connecting is declining, and more devices are capturing data. 

All kinds of things are being used in IoT applications such as:

* security cameras
* cable set-top boxes
* refrigerators
* industrial systems
* conveyor belts
* manufacturing equipment
* commercial devices
* traffic signals
* smart meters

Any device that can be powered on could potentially be part of an IoT application.  

Consumers are now expecting everything in their home, everything they drive, and even what they wear to have IoT capabilities.

Sensor network research projects have generated volumes of observation data for application domains:

* agriculture
* environmental science
* engineering
* health care

However, very little of the data collected in these projects has been made available in the public domain for other scientists.

This problem is known colloquially as the “data graveyard problem,” and is a significant barrier for sensor network researchers, not least because the impact of sensor networks designed for habitat and environmental monitoring will be measured by their ability to enable new applications and produce new results otherwise too difficult to realize.

Enter [gump.io](http://gump.io), the open source answer to the problem. Your job is to capture everything from a weather tracking device and store and manipulate its data.

### So Why the Internet of Things?

IoT is important because it makes previously unusable data available; IoT applications tap into device data and let you visualize, explore, and build sophisticated analytics such as machine learning in the cloud. They can also run on devices so they can respond in real-time as events unfold. 

For example, a predictive model for scene detection analysis could run on a security camera and, when the camera sees suspicious activity, it could send an alert.

IoT applications are deployed across a wide range of use cases:

* connected homes
* connected vehicles
* healthcare
* industrial
* retail

and so much more.

IoT applications are used for industrial use cases to:

* improve processes
* create new revenue streams
* reduce costs
* increase safety by analyzing data from equipment
* creating predictive maintenance models
* keeping devices up to date with over-the-air updates

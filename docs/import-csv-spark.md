## Import CSV Files into HBase using Spark


This is a Spark application in java. I have coded it in generic way so it could handle any CSV file schema without requiring a code change. This doesn't perform any transformations of the given data though, just plain import CSV as such to a HBase table.


## Input parameters

The csv files to import, the hbase table name & schema are provided in the YAML file `params.yml` and passed to the application. The `rowKey` and the `value` under `rowValues` corresponds to the CSV file headers. The input could also be a pattern like `worldcupplayerinfo_*.csv` to import data from multiple files into the table.

## Execution

* Create HBase table by logging into the hbase shell:

```bash
create 'players_data', 'main'
```

* Make required changes in the `params.yml` file and submit the job using spark-submit:

```bash
spark-submit --class examples.spark.ImportCsvToHBase --master yarn target/import-csv-to-hbase-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar params.yml
```

* The data from CSV should be written to the table as per the schema in the `params.yml` file. Check the hbase shell & verify:

```bash
scan 'players_data'
```

Have written a [blog](http://sathish.me/java/2017/09/24/import-data-from-csv-files-to-hbase-using-spark.html) explaining the code, execution & debugging. Feel free to modify & use based on your requirements. Let me know if there is something that I can help with.
